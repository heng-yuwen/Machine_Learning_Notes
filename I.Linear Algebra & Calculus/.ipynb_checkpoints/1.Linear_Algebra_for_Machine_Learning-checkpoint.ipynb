    "*Neural* is a special type of cell, which can receive and pass information in a complex neural system. It is not necessary for us to know the biology concepts very well. All we need to know is that, by manipulating to the information that it receives, neural can help people understand the world and react to the views that we see or the voice that we hear. \n",
